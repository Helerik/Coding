# Coding
Any sort of code I've written.

In this repository you will find:
 - Some of my college assignments inside directory 'Faculdade'*.
 - Some python codes (inside 'Python Codes') I wrote, which include some games I made with tkinter,
   math related codes, some simple physics simulations and a 'Misc' folder,
   where I store some simple ideas that I wanted to test out.
 - There is a directory dedicated to competitions on Kaggle, but I haven't done much yet.
 - There is another directory dedicated to competitions on Driven Data.
 - Finally, there is a directory ('Cursos') containing code I wrote for tutorials, courses or books I read or am still reading.
 
(*) Some directories included in 'Faculdade' store not only code, but sometimes .pdf reports, which might explain 
    the mathematical theory behind the implemented algorithm aswell as results for the assignment.
