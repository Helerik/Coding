% Non-Linear Classification:
% If the classification is non-linear, many features will create too many 
% variables to handle. Can be expensive and cause overfitting.
% Reducing the problem may cause the shape of the hypothesis to be too simple.
%
% New Idea: Neurons and brains! i.e. neural networks.
% Simulate the way the brain works. It is believed that the brain has a single
% "algorithm" for comouting all learning, whichever it may be.
%
% Layer 1: Input layer (x)
% Layer {2 to n-1}: Hidden layers
% Layer n: Output layer (y = f(x))
%
% The neural network "finds out" its own features to compute non-linear
% functions.
