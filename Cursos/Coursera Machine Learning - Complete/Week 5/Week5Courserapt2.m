% Neural Networks: Putting it all together

% 1 - No. of input units (dimension of features)
% 2 - No. of output units (numberr of classes)
% y = {1,2,...,10}; y = 5 -> y = [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]
% 3 - No. of hidden layers and number of hidden units per layer

% Later on how to choose these numbers... (3)

% Training the Net.

% 1 - Randomly initialize weights
% 2 - Implement forward propagation
% 3 - Implement code to compute cost function J(theta)
% 4 - Implement backpropagation to compute partial derivatives
% 5 - Optional: check gradient with numerical estimate of derivative of J
% 6 - Use gradient descent or other optimization method to minimize J(theta)
