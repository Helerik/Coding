	<h1 class="header">Combining Selectors</h1>
	<p>
		We are able to combine selectors. For example, doing p.big {...}
		would apply the style to all paragraphs with the big class.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another way of combining selectors is applying the styling to a direct child
		of a certain tag, by doing something like &quot;p &gt; span&quot;. For example this <span>span piece of text, which is inside a paragraph.</span>
	</p>
	<span>This span piece of text is not affected by the styling.</span>
	<div>
		We can have descendant selector. The rule applies whenever the element is an inside 
		another element no matter how many levels inside it is.
		<div>
			This next piece of text, for example:
			<p>
				Hello there!
			</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<p class="highlight">
		This paragraph has highlight class.
	</p>
	<div class="highlight">
		This div has highlight class.
	</div>
	<p class="highlight mainpoint">
		This paragraph has two classes assigned to it.
	</p>
