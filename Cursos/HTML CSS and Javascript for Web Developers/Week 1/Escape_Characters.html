	<h1>Escape Characters</h1>
	<p>
		&quot;If I want to make an html tutorial on a web-page I'll need to use &lt; and &gt;
		characters. There is also the and (&amp;) and copyright (&copy;) characters.
		If I want a piece of text to be glued together, and not break when there is no 
		space left to write on the line, we can use&nbsp;this&nbsp;charecter.&quot;
		Look at these special characters! &alpha; &beta; &gamma; &lambda;.
